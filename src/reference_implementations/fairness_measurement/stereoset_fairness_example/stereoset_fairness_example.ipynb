For inter-sentence samples, each sample has a piec of  context followed by 3 sentences, where each sentence would have an associated label of \"stereotype\", \"anti-stereotype\", and \"unrelated\", and the prompt should be constructed as context + sentence. For intra-sentence samples, the context for each sample would have a \"BLANK\" to be filled, and the 3 sentences would fill the \"BLANK\" with different text.\n",

    "Context: ```Many people live in Ethiopia.```\n",

    "There isn't a universal preferred label for all data samples. For example, in the inter-sentence example above, we might prefer the model to assign the highest likelihood to the unrelated sentence (or even the stereotype sentence), but in the intra-sentence example, the ideal language model would assign stereotype and anti-stereotype sentences equal likelihoods."
